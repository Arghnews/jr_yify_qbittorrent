This project is a small qBittorrent plugin in Python3 that searches yify for movies. It uses and was made as a way to learn more about python's (awesome) asyncio stuff. Using asyncio means it can utilise a very small (possibly 1) number of threads (under the hood, this is an implementation detail of asyncio) to search many connections/pages in parallel quickly.

I do not endorse pirating movies in any way.
